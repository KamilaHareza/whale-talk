## Overview
There are a few simple rules for translating text to whale language:

- There are no consonants. Only vowels excluding “y”.
- The u‘s and e‘s are extra long, so we must double them in our program.

Once text is converted to the whale language, the result is sung slowly, as is a custom in the ocean.

## Built with
- `JavaScript`

## What I learned
To accomplish this translation, I used my knowledge of loops. I also had to create arrays and their methods. Each loop had to iterate input or vowels that I needed in translation. It was quick and fun project to do.
